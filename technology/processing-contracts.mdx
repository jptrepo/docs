## Context

### What is the purpose of this policy or procedure?

The University of Virginia does not allow employees to sign contracts or act as a signatory authority on behalf of the University. Failure to adhere to this University policy subjects the School and employee to financial and legal liability. This procedure defines how the UVA Engineering IT Office will process software contracts, end-user license agreements, terms & conditions agreements, and purchases.

### When is this policy or procedure applied?

This procedure is applied when any of the following conditions are met:

- A vendor requires a signed contract.
- An end user must agree to Terms & Conditions related to a software or IT purchase or installation (e.g., EULA).
- A vendor is handling sensitive, highly sensitive, or mission critical data.

### Policy Exceptions:

- Software available via the ITS website does not require additional vetting and is exempt from this process.
- Software considered "Low-cost, Low-risk" according to University policy is exempt.

---

## Definitions

- **Contract Vendor:** Has at least one negotiated contract in place with the University and/or the Commonwealth of Virginia. Using a contract vendor allows for streamlined purchasing up to $200,000 without additional quotes or vendor registration.
- **Data Protection Addendum (DPA):** Add-on to University Purchasing Terms and Conditions for vendors handling University Data.
- **Data Protection of University Information:** Process ensuring compliance with University policies for sensitive and highly sensitive data (e.g., IRM-003).
- **End User:** Individuals or groups (faculty, staff, students, researchers, vendors) who consume goods or services.
- **Highly Sensitive Data (HSD):** Data requiring legal restrictions on access (e.g., personal info, health data).
- **Information Security Compliance Team (InfoSec):** UVA ITS division assisting with compliance and vetting.
- **Online Clickwrap Agreement:** Legal contract formed when a user clicks "I agree."
- **Registered Vendor:** Vendor pre-registered in Workday/Marketplace, payable by PO.
- **Sensitive Data (SD):** Data that may be withheld under FOIA, not public records, not PHI.
- **Signatory Authority:** Individuals authorized to bind the University contractually (per FIN-036).
- **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):** Subscription-based centrally hosted software; constitutes a legal contract.
- **Terms & Conditions:** Legal agreement setting out rights and responsibilities of parties.

## Procedure

- All vendors with access to UVA data should undergo review by InfoSec before purchase or use; Eng IT Service Operations Manager oversees vetting.

- Route all requests for non-exempt software purchases to the IT Service Operations Manager via the Request for Review of Software Agreement form.

- Encourage non-registered suppliers to register, enabling PO payment. Collect vendor contact info (name, title, email, phone) on the Contract and Purchases form. Preferred payment is via PO; avoid T&E card use when possible.

- If a T&E card must be used, finalize payment only after Procurement reviews and approves Terms & Conditions (and completes InfoSec review if applicable).

- For free software with non-negotiable terms, end users must select alternative solutions with negotiable agreements.

- Upon Procurement approval of contracts or terms & conditions:

  - Procurement issues a signed copy to ENG IT.
  - If vendor is registered, Procurement issues a PO; otherwise, T&E card payment can be processed.

- Engineering IT Office members must comply with these procedures and all relevant University policies.
